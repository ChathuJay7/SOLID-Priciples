# SOLID Principles

The SOLID principle helps in reducing tight coupling. Tight coupling means a group of classes are highly dependent on one another which you should avoid in your code. Opposite of tight coupling is loose coupling and your code is considered as a good code when it has loosely-coupled classes. Loosely coupled classes minimize changes in your code, helps in making code more reusable, maintainable, flexible and stable.
